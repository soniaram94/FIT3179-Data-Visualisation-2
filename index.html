      <h1>Disability in Australia</h1>
      <p class="sub">This visualisation explores patterns of disability across Australia through a series of interactive charts. It examines how disability varies by gender, age, and type of limitation, the level of support people require for daily activities, and the different sources of discrimination experienced by those living with disability. Together, these visuals provide a broad yet detailed view of the social and demographic factors that shape disability experiences in Australia.</p>

          <h3>Gender trends over time</h3>
            <p>This chart tracks changes in disability prevalence among males and females from 2003 to 2022. Both groups show a steady rise over time, with a sharper increase beginning around 2019. This surge may be linked to the effects of COVID-19, greater awareness of long-term health impacts, and an ageing population. Females consistently record higher disability numbers, which may reflect their longer life expectancy and higher likelihood of experiencing chronic health conditions. Overall, the trend highlights a growing need for health and support services across both genders.</p>

          <h3>Age patterns</h3>
            <p>This chart compares disability estimates across different age groups and types of limitations. The data shows a clear upward trend in disability prevalence with increasing age, particularly beyond 60 years. As people age, physical decline, chronic health conditions, and mobility challenges become more common, contributing to higher rates of limitation. Individuals aged 70 and over experience noticeably greater disability across all categories, with physical limitations being the most dominant type. The highest estimates occur among those aged 80 and above, highlighting the significant link between ageing and disability.</p>

        <h3>Disability type prevalence</h3>
          <p>This chart shows the distribution of different disability types in Australia. The most common type is restriction in physical activities or work, affecting around 45% of people with a disability. This is followed by chronic or recurring pain, sensory impairments like hearing loss, and mobility difficulties, each representing a significant share of the population. Physical disabilities are the most prevalent overall, reflecting the strong link between disability and physical health conditions. Psychosocial and intellectual disabilities occur less frequently but still represent an important group. Many individuals experience multiple disability types at once, highlighting the complexity of disability experiences and the importance of inclusive health and support services.</p>
          <p>Following this, chronic or recurring pain, sensory impairments such as hearing or vision loss, and mobility difficulties also contribute significantly to disability prevalence. These physical conditions are often interrelated, for example, chronic pain can restrict mobility, while reduced mobility can lead to further muscular weakness or social isolation. Psychosocial and intellectual disabilities appear less frequently but remain important categories, as they reflect the mental and emotional dimensions of disability that are less visible but equally impactful.</p>

          <p>This chart shows the types of daily activities where people with disabilities require assistance, grouped by severity level. Mobility shows the highest need for assistance, with around 395.1 thousand people with profound disabilities and 333.2 thousand with severe disabilities requiring help. This category consistently ranks above others such as self-care or cognitive tasks, reflecting how physical limitations can significantly affect independent movement.</p>
          <p>Individuals with profound and severe disabilities consistently require more help across all activities, while moderate cases often manage more independently. The pattern highlights how physical and cognitive limitations significantly affect daily functioning, emphasising the importance of accessible care and tailored assistance programs.</p>

          <h4>Experiences of Discrimination and Social Barriers</h4>
          <p>
            People with disability in Australia experience discrimination from a range of sources, affecting their confidence, wellbeing, and ability to participate fully in society. These experiences can arise in workplaces, public spaces, or even within personal relationships, often leading to heightened anxiety and social isolation. Patterns across the data reveal that discrimination is not only widespread but varies across regions and severity levels, reflecting deep-rooted social and structural inequalities. Addressing these barriers is essential to creating a more inclusive and supportive environment for all Australians with disability.

          <p>This chart explores the different sources of discrimination experienced by people with disabilities in Australia. It reveals that strangers and public interactions are among the most common sources of unfair treatment, followed closely by workplaces and service providers. These settings often involve daily interactions where accessibility barriers, unconscious bias, or lack of awareness can manifest as exclusionary behaviour. While discrimination can occur across all groups, individuals with severe or profound disabilities are generally more affected, facing not only physical but also social obstacles that limit participation in everyday life.</p>
          <p>Family or friends also emerge as a notable source, suggesting that stigma and misunderstanding can persist even within close personal relationships. This highlights how discrimination is not only structural but also deeply social, influenced by attitudes, assumptions, and discomfort surrounding disability</p>

          <p>This map highlights state-level differences in experiences of disability-related discrimination across Australia. New South Wales records the highest number, with approximately 109.7 thousand people reporting experiences of discrimination, a figure that reflects both its large population and possibly greater public interaction among people with disabilities.</p>
          <p>In contrast, the Northern Territory shows the lowest count, at around 3.4 thousand, likely influenced by its smaller population and regional dispersion. States such as Victoria and Queensland also report high numbers, following similar population trends, while smaller states like Tasmania and the ACT report lower values. These variations reveal how factors such as population density, access to disability support services, and social attitudes toward inclusion can shape the lived experiences of discrimination across different parts of the country.</p>

          <h4>Final Insights: Rethinking Disability Inclusion</h4>
          <p>
            Across all these visuals, a clear message emerges, disability is not only a matter of individual health but also of social inclusion and access. The growing number of Australians living with disability highlights the pressing need for stronger government support, sustainable healthcare funding, and investment in aged care and rehabilitation services. Regional differences and patterns of discrimination show that access to support is uneven, and that awareness and education must extend beyond policy into everyday life. As Australia’s population continues to age, improving accessibility, workplace inclusion, and public health systems will be vital steps toward a more equitable society where every person, regardless of ability, can participate fully and with dignity.
